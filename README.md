# GO SNAKE

## Description

Demo game using the [ebitengine](https://ebitengine.org/). The idea was to make a quick and simple project using Go, as I've been feeling like writing in that language.

Even though it was a very quick project, halfway through I started wondering how I could improve performance (the game was running perfectly from the start since it's very simple, but still). So maybe it has reawakened my interest in game development.
